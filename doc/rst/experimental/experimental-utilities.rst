Experimental Utilities
======================

Experimental utilities are under active development. They are not considered to
be production worthy, but they are available in the distribution for those
interested in developing them further or to provide additional examples. To
enable experimental utilities, run configure with the enable experimental
option.

.. code-block:: Bash
    $./configure --enable-experimental
