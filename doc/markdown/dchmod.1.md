% DCHMOD(1)

# NAME
dchmod - distributed tool to set permissions and group

# SYNOPSIS
**dchmod [OPTION] PATH...**

# DESCRIPTION

Parallel MPI application to recurseively change permissions and/or group from a top level directory. 

dchmod provides functionality similar to *chmod(1)* and *chgrp(1)*. Like *chmod(1)*, the tool supports the use of octal or symbolic mode to change the permissions.

# OPTIONS

-i, \--input FILE
:	Read source list from FILE.  FILE must be generated by another tool from the mpiFileUtils suite.

-g, \--group GROUP 
:   Change group to specified GROUP name. 

-m, \--mode MODE
:   The mode that you want the file or directory to be.  MODE may be octal or symbolic syntax similar to chmod(1).  In symbolic notation, "ugoa" are supported as are "rwxX".

--exclude REGEX
:   Do not modify items whose full path matches REGEX (regexec).

--match REGEX
:   Only modify items whose full path matches REGEX (regexec).

--name 
:   Change --exclude and --match to apply to item name rather than its full path.

-v, \--verbose 
: 	Run in verbose mode.  Prints a list of statistics/timing data for the command. How many files walked, how many levels there are in the tree, and how many files the command operated on. This option also prints the files/sec for each of those.

-h, \--help 
: 	Print the command usage, and the list of options available. 

# EXAMPLES

1. Use octal mode to change permissions:

mpirun -np 128 dchmod --mode 755 /directory

2. Use symbolic mode to change permissions (you can list modes for user, group, etc if you separate them with a comma):

mpirun -np 129 dchmod --group mygroup --mode u+r,g+rw /directory

3. Change permissions to u+rw on all files/directories EXCEPT those whose name match regex:

mpirun -np 128 dchmod --name --exclude 'afilename' --mode u+rw /directory

Note: You can use --match to change file permissions on all of the files/directories that match the regex.
