\f[B]dcmp [OPTION] SOURCE DEST \f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Parallel MPI application to compare two files or to recurseively compare
files with same prefix path within two different directories.
This tool is similar to \f[I]cmp(1)\f[].
It reports how many files in two different directories are the same (or
different).
.PP
dcmp provides functionality similar to a recursive \f[I]cmp(1)\f[].
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-base
Do a base comparison.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-output <FIELD0=STATE0@FIELD1=STATE1,FIELD2=STATE2:FILE>
write output fields and states to a file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Run in verbose mode.
Prints a list of statistics/timing data for the command.
Files walked, started, completed, seconds, files, bytes read, byte rate,
and file rate.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "1." 3
Compare two files in different directories:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 dcmp /src1/file1 /src2/file2
.IP "2." 3
Compare two directories with verbose output.
The verbose output prints timing and number of bytes read:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 dcmp \-v /src1 /src2
