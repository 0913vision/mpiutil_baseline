.SH NAME
.PP
drm \- distributed remove
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]drm [OPTION] PATH...\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Parallel MPI application to recursively delete a directory and its
contents.
.PP
drm is a tool for removing files recurseivly in parallel.
drm is similar to \f[I]rm(1)\f[], but unlike \f[I]rm(1)\f[] there is no
need to pass a recursive option as files will be removed from the top
level directory to the bottom of the file tree by default.
.PP
Be careful: it behaves like \f[I]rm \-rf\f[], but it is much faster.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input 
Read source list from FILE.
FILE must be generated by another tool from the mpiFileUtils suite.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-lite
Walk file system without stat.
.RS
.RE

.TP
.B \-\-match 
Only remove items whose full path matches REGEX (regexec).

.RE
.TP
.B \-\-name
Change \-\-exclude and \-\-match to apply to item name rather than its
full path.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-dryrun
Print out a list of files that \f[B]would\f[] be deleted.
This is useful to check list of items satisfying \-\-exclude or
\-\-match options without deleting them.

To delete a directory and its contents:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 drm \-v /dir/to/delete
.IP "2." 3
Delete all items (files and directories) ending with .core from
directory tree:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 drm \-\-match \[aq].core$\[aq] /dir/to/delete/from
.IP "3." 3
