dcp \- distributed file copy program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]dcp [OPTION] SOURCE DEST\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
dcp is a file copy tool in the spirit of \f[I]cp(1)\f[] that evenly
distributes work across a large cluster without any centralized state.
It is designed for copying files which are located on a distributed
parallel file system.
The method used in the file copy process is a self\-stabilization
algorithm which enables per\-node autonomous processing and a token
passing scheme to detect termination.
Unlike \f[I]cp(1)\f[] there is no need to use a recursive option, as dcp
will copy from the top level directory to the bottom of the file tree by
default.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug=\f[I]level\f[]
Specify the level of debug information to output.
Level may be one of: \f[I]fatal\f[], \f[I]err\f[], \f[I]warn\f[],
\f[I]info\f[], or \f[I]dbg\f[].
Increasingly verbose debug levels include the output of less verbose
debug levels.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-force
Remove existing destination files if creation or truncation fails.
If the destination filesystem is specified to be unreliable
(\f[C]\-U\f[], \f[C]\-\-unreliable\-filesystem\f[]), this option may
lower performance since each failure will cause the entire file to be
invalidated and copied again.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-grouplock
Use Lustre grouplock when reading/writing a file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-i
Read an input list from a file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-input
Preserve the original files owner, group, permissions (including the
setuid and setgid bits), time of last modification and time of last
access.
In case duplication of owner or group fails, the setuid and setgid bits
are cleared.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-synchronous
Use synchronous read/write calls (0_DIRECT)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-sparse
Create sparse files when possible.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a brief message listing the \f[I]dcp(1)\f[] options and usage.

.SS Known bugs
.PP
When the force option is specified and truncation fails, the copy and
truncation will be stuck in an infinite loop until the truncation
operation returns with success.
.PP
The maximum supported filename length for any file transfered is
approximately 4068 characters.
This may be less than the number of characters that your operating
system supports.
.PP
Using the \-S option for sparse files does not work yet at LLNL.
If you try to use it then dcp will default to a normal copy.
