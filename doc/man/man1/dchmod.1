.SH NAME
.PP
dchmod \- distributed chmod program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]dchmod [OPTION] PATH...\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Parallel MPI application to recurseively walk, and then change
permissions starting from the top level directory.
.PP
dchmod prrovides functionality similar to \f[I]chmod(1)\f[].
Like \f[I]chmod(1)\f[], the tool supports the use of octal or symbolic
mode to change the permissions.
But unlinke \f[I]chmod(1)\f[], there is no need to use a recursive
option, as the permissions will be updated from the top level directory
all the way to the bottom of the tree by default.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-group 
Change group to specified group name.

.B \-m, \-\-match 
Match a set of files from command given a regular expression.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-name
Match or exclude the regular expression based only on file name, and not
the full path.
Should be used in combination with the match and/or exclude options if
you don not want to match/exclude the full path name, but just the file
name.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print the command usage, and the list of options available.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Prints a list of statistics/timing data for the command.
How many files walked, how many levels there are in the tree, and how
many files the command operated on.
This option also prints the files/sec for each of those.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Example will use 4 nodes:
.IP "1." 3
salloc \-N4 \-ppdebug
.PP
Use octal mode to change permissions:
.IP "2." 3
srun \-n4 dchmod \-m 755 /directory
.PP
Use symbolic mode to change permissions (you can list modes for user,
group, etc if you separate them with a comma):
.IP "3." 3
srun \-n4 dchmod \-g deg \-m u+r,g+rw /directory
.PP
Change permissions to u+rw on all files/directories EXCEPT those that
match regex:
.IP "4." 3
srun \-n4 dchmod \-\-name \-\-exclude afilename \-m u+rw /directory
.PP
Note: You can also do #4 the same with the \-\-match option instead.
It will change file permissions on all of the files/directories that
match the regex.
