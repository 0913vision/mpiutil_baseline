.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]dchmod [OPTION] PATH...\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Parallel MPI application to recurseively change permissions and/or group
from a top level directory.
.PP
dchmod provides functionality similar to \f[I]chmod(1)\f[] and
\f[I]chgrp(1)\f[].
Like \f[I]chmod(1)\f[], the tool supports the use of octal or symbolic
mode to change the permissions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input 
Read source list from FILE.
FILE must be generated by another tool from the mpiFileUtils suite.
.RS

.RE
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mode

.TP
.B \-\-exclude 
Do not modify items whose full path matches REGEX (regexec).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-match 
Only modify items whose full path matches REGEX (regexec).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-name
Change \-\-exclude and \-\-match to apply to item name rather than its
full path.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Run in verbose mode.
Prints a list of statistics/timing data for the command.
How many files walked, how many levels there are in the tree, and how
many files the command operated on.
This option also prints the files/sec for each of those.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Example will use 4 nodes:
.IP "1." 3
Use octal mode to change permissions:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 dchmod \-\-mode 755 /directory
.IP "2." 3
Use symbolic mode to change permissions (you can list modes for user,
group, etc if you separate them with a comma):
.PP
mpirun \-np 129 dchmod \-\-group mygroup \-\-mode u+r,g+rw /directory
.IP "3." 3
Change permissions to u+rw on all files/directories EXCEPT those whose
name match regex:
.PP
mpirun \-np 128 dchmod \-\-name \-\-exclude \[aq]afilename\[aq] \-\-mode
u+rw /directory
.PP
Note: You can use \-\-match to change file permissions on all of the
files/directories that match the regex.
