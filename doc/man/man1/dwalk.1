.SH NAME
.PP
dwalk \- distributed file listing program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
dwalk can walk a file tree in parallel with various different options.
You can sort the output of the distributed file walk based on different
fields (i.e name, use, group, size, etc), or get a file list
distribution that will put the amount of files you have of a certain
size into bins specified by the user.
For instance, if you wanted to know how many files in a large directory
have 0 bytes then you would use the \-\-distribution option.

Print the file distribution by field.
So, for the size field you could do size:0,80,100 which would then tell
you how many files from the directory and/or subdirectories you pass in
are between 0\-0 bytes, 1\-80 bytes, 81\-99 bytes, and 100 \- MAX file
size bytes.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Example will use 4 nodes: 1.
salloc \-N4 \-ppdebug
.PP
Walk a file path: 2.
srun \-n4 dwalk /src
.PP
Walk a file path & print to terminal with verbose output.
Verbose output will also give you the # of directories, files, and links
from the top level: 3.
srun \-n4 dwalk \-p \-v /src
.PP
Print to screen with verbose output the file distribution based on the
size field from the top level directory.
4.
srun \-n4 dwalk \-p \-v \-d size:0,20,1G src/
.PP
So, #4 will give you something like the following:
.PP
syrah144{user1}173: install/bin/dwalk \-p \-v \-d size:0,20,1G testing/
