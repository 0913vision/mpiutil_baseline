dwalk \- distributed file listing program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
dwalk can walk a file tree in parallel with various different options.
You can sort the output of the distributed file walk based on different
fields (i.e name, use, group, size, etc), or get a file list
distribution that will put the amount of files you have of a certain
size into bins specified by the user.
For instance, if you wanted to know how many files in a large directory
have 0 bytes then you would use the \-\-distribution option.
