dwalk \- distributed walk and list

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
.B dwalk [OPTION] PATH...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
Parallel MPI application to recursively walk and list contents in a directory.
.TP
dwalk provides functionality similar to \f[B]ls\f[] and \f[B]du\f[].  Like \f[B]du\f[], the tool report a summary of the total number of files and bytes.  Like \f[B]ls\f[], the tool sorts and prints information about individual files.
.TP
It can save the list to a file or read input from a previously saved file.  The file must be generated or read by a tool in the FileUtils suite.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input FILE
Read list of files from FILE.  FILE must be generated by another tool from the FileUtils suite.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-output FILE
Write list of files to FILE.  FILE is intended to be read by another tool from the FileUtils suite.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-lite
Walk file system with minimal stat calls.  Capture only the file name and file type for each file.  Otherwise full stat information is captured, including file size, access times, and permissions.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-sort FIELDS
Sort list of files by various fields.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-print
Print details of files to screen.  Output is limited to first and last 20 entries.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Enable verbose messages while running.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a brief usage message.

.SH SORT FIELDS
.TP
By default, the list of files dwalk captures is not sorted.  To sort the list, one or more fields can be specified in a comma-delimited list:
.TP
name,user,group,uid,gid,atime,mtime,ctime,size
.TP
A field name can be preceded with '-' to sort in reverse order.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
(1) To print summary information for a directory:
.TP
.nf
mpirun -np 128 dwalk -v /dir/to/walk
.fi
.TP
(2) To print a list of files, sorted by file size, then by file name:
.TP
.nf
mpirun -np 128 dwalk -p -s size,name /dir/to/walk
.fi
.TP
(2) To save the list of files:
.TP
.nf
mpirun -np 128 dwalk -o out.dwalk /dir/to/walk
.fi

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
(1) To copy dir1 as dir2:
.TP
.nf
mpirun -np 128 dcp /source/dir1 /dest/dir2
.fi
.TP
(2) To copy contents of dir1 into dir2:
.TP
.nf
mkdir /dest/dir2
mpirun -np 128 dcp /source/dir1/* /dest/dir2
.fi
.TP
(3) To save the list of files:
.TP
.nf
mpirun -np 128 dwalk -o out.dwalk /dir/to/walk
.fi
