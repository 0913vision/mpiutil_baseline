dwalk - parallel walk and sort
dcp   - parallel copy
drm   - parallel remove

dwalk is a prototype tool to execute a directory walk and then optionally sort the output.
It executes a walk starting from a top-level directory and it calls stat for every file and directory.
It can also execute a "lite walk" in which it avoids calling stat and distinguishes directories from files using the d_type returned in readdir().
It can write the results of its walk to a file, and these files may be specified as input in order to avoid the walk.
It can sort file information by a number of fields, e.g., by filename, size, or access time.
It uses libcircle to implement the parallel file walk, and it uses dtcmp for parallel sorting.

To build:
  MVAPICH2 v1.9:
    1) modify the buildme_mvapich script to match your network and resource manager
       (it's currently set up for Mellanox IB interconnects and SLURM)
    2) run the buildme_mvapich script to download and build MVAPICH2-1.9

  Open MPI v1.7.1 (not yet supported):
    1) modify the buildme_openmpi script if needed
    2) run buildme_autotools
    3) run buildme_openmpi

  Other dependencies (libcircle, lwgrp, dtcmp):
    1) modify buildme_dependencies script to use correct MPI library
    2) run the buildme_dependencies script to download and build dependent libs

  Tools (dcp, dwalk, drm):
    1) modify buildme script to use correct MPI library
    2) run the buildme script to build dcp, dwalk, and drm

Example run commands:
  1) Walk current working directory
    mpirun -np 2 ./dwalk -v `pwd`

  2) Walk current working directory, sort by ascending filename, print results
    mpirun -np 2 ./dwalk -v -p -s name `pwd`

  3) Walk current working directory and write list to cache.out file
    mpirun -np 2 ./dwalk -v -c cache.out `pwd`

  4) Read list from cache.out, sort by descending atime
    mpirun -np 2 ./dwalk -v -s -atime -c cache.out

Example copy:
  1) mpirun -np 2 ./dcp -p -c /dir /newdir

Example remove:
  1) mpirun -np 2 ./drm -v /newdir
