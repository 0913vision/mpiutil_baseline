Submitting code
===============
When submitting code to dcp, please fork the project and create a new branch
named to reflect your changes before submitting a new pull request.

To produce a clean changeset, we ask that you perform an interactive rebase
before submitting a pull request to make commits easier to understand.

Clean, documented, and understandable code is required. At a minimum, we ask
that you follow the options listed in astyle.options in the top directory of
the repository. New code should not generate any warnings from newer versions
of clang or gcc.

Continuous Integration
======================
If you have trouble building dcp, please check the continuous integration
status at <https://travis-ci.org/hpc/dcp>.
